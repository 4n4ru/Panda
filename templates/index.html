        <h2>About Project Panda</h2>
        <p>In this phase, the app is available for companies to sign up and create a profile for them. A set of questions are provided and companies are encouraged to give as detailed description as possible. Through this process, companies are pushed to RETHINK and perhaps REVAMP their workplace to make it more accessible to all.</p>
